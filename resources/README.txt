Before implementing the controller and view, some slight changes were made to the model. After re-evaluation of the previous model, the methods alone were not sufficient enough to contain the needed information . Due to this, additional methods including one that returned a list of all snapshots with their ID, a list of all IShapes for the specified snapshot and a method that returned the first snapshot taken. This was done so that implementation of the controller would be much simpler, more data could easily be stored and to improve efficiency of the program overall. 

The controller is able to read in an input file and scan the text. Based on the first word of the line, the controller updates the model with the specific data that needed to be stored. In addition to this, the controller has helper methods to facilitate information between the view and the model. The controller is essentially the middle-man between the model and the view. It coordinates the information between both.

The view takes information given to it by the controller to set up. The view uses JFrame, JButton and JPanels to create a graphical representation of the album. Separate class buttons were also made for each feature. They are interactive so that the album can be sorted through. The HTML view also uses information given to it by the controller. With the user given information, the HTML view appends to an output file based on the snapshots taken. This appended html file name is the output specified by the user.
